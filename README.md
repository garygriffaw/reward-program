# Reward Program
This is a sample program written with Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and Bootstrap. 

The application is based on a rewards program offered by a retailer.
The grand total and monthly totals are calculated based on purchase amounts for each customer. 
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

To see the webpage with the results, run the application then go to http://localhost:8080/customers/rewards.
